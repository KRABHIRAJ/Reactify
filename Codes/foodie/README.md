# [Foodies: A swiggy clone](https://suiggy.netlify.app/)

It's a food ordering web app which comprises of home page where list of all restaurants has been shown. We can look into the restaurant's menu & add to cart functionality is also there. cart page comprises all the items which we have added to cart.

 => Used swiggy's live api to get the data.   
 => Used Redux to enable add to cart functionality.  
 => Used routing to switch between pages seamlessly.  
 => Used lazy loading to split the chunks and load whenever required.  
 => Used [React loading skeleton](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-loading-skeleton) to show shimmer UI while getting the data from API for better UX.  
 => Created multiple custom hooks to handle api calls.
 => Used cloudflare worker to create proxy to handle CORS issue.
